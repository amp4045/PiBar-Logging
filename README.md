# PiBar-Logging
A full walk-through for a self-logging barcode scanner using a Raspberry Pi



Simplicity. Functionality.  Often times you do not hear, or see, those two words next to each other in today's society.
This documentation will supply you with a complete walk-through, and part list, a "how-to" if you will, on turning your personal Raspberry Pi into an elegantly designed, self-logging bardcode scanner.  I like to call this **PiBar Logging**.

First, lets talk about the items you'll need.

At the time being, the cheap option via Amazon was to buy Canakit's " Raspberry Pi 2 Ultimate Starter kit (clear case) bundle. This may not be the case anymore.

For your project you'll need the following items:
  
  1  Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (I chose this one for the amount of USB ports the device had (4))
  1  Micro SD card with NOOBS installed
  1  Wifi Dongle
  1  USB Flash Drive (any size 1GB or larger will work)
  1  2.5A Power Supply for Raspberry Pi's
  1  USB Barcode Scanner (any scanner will do -- for my build, I used one from Alacrity)
  
Gather those items, and you'll be set!
