# PiBar-Logging
A full walk-through for a self-logging barcode scanner using a Raspberry Pi



Simplicity. Functionality.  Often times you do not hear, or see, those two words next to each other in today's society.
This documentation will supply you with a complete walk-through, and part list, a "how-to" if you will, on turning your personal Raspberry Pi into an elegantly designed, self-logging bardcode scanner.  I like to call this **PiBar Logging**.
